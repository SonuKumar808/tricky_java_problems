@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyAction {

    void run();
    boolean equals(Object obj);
}

// ques: Is this a valid functional interface?
// the equals() method is already part of java's object class
// which means every class and interface already has this method

// final answer: Yes, this is a valid functional interface.
// ✔ It has exactly one abstract method (run()).
// ✔ equals(Object obj) is a method from Object, and does not count toward the abstract method count.
